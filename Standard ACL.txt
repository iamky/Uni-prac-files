- Now, you  have to configure Routing Protocol (OSPF)


All Routers Configured !!

















			Now Lets Create Standard ACL's



We have 4 Departments viz,
Sales, Marketing, R&D and Administartion














1. Using Standard ACL will block all Traffic entering
   in Administration department from Sales Dept


Router(config)#access-list 5 deny 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 
Router(config)#access-list 5 permit any
Router#
Router(config)#int f0/0
Router(config-if)#ip access-group 5 out



Note: To Remove ACL

Router(config-if)#no ip access-group 5 out
Router(config)#no access-list 5















2. Now lets block R&D First PC from accessing marketing entire network

and also allow other Clients in R&D in Accessing entire Marketing nw.
















Hence we did it





Standard ACL is done
