- Now, you  have to configure Routing Protocol (OSPF)


All Routers Configured !!

















			Now Lets Create Extended ACL's



We have 4 Departments viz,
Sales, Marketing, R&D and Administartion














1. Using Standard ACL will block all outgoing trafffice entering
   in Administration department from Sales Dept host


Router(config)#access-list 5 deny 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 
Router(config)#access-list 5 permit any
Router#
Router(config)#int f0/0
Router(config-if)#ip access-group 5 out



Note: To Remove ACL

Router(config-if)#no ip access-group 5 out
Router(config)#no access-list 5















2. Now lets block R&D First PC from accessing marketing entire network

and also allow other Clients in R&D in Accessing entire Marketing nw.






When to use In or out for ACL?
- It all depends on where the packet or data is originating

Suppose in Standard ACL, if the packet is originating in Sales Dept
 and you want to block it from accessing Admin Dept, the we have to configure the it to nearest possible destination Router.

So when the packet Enters the Admin Dept it is IN, and comes OUT 
from the f0/0 interface, so Use OUT bound for Standard ACL










So incase of Extended ACL, we configure the ACL nearest to Source.

So now the traffic is originating from Sales Dept , so it will be IN bound to router from f0/0, and will leave router from s2/0 interface 









Hence we did it





Extended ACL is done
